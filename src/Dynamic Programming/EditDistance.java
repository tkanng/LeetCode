This is a classic problem of Dynamic Programming. We define the state dp[i][j] to be the minimum number of operations to convert word1[0..i - 1] to word2[0..j - 1].
The state equations have two cases: the boundary case and the general case. Note that in the above notations, both i and j take values starting from 1.

For the boundary case, that is, to convert a string to an empty string, it is easy to see that the mininum number of operations to convert word1[0..i - 1] to "" requires at least i operations (deletions). In fact, the boundary case is simply:

dp[i][0] = i;
dp[0][j] = j.
Now let's move on to the general case, that is, convert a non-empty word1[0..i - 1] to another non-empty word2[0..j - 1].
Well, let's try to break this problem down into smaller problems (sub-problems). Suppose we have already known how to convert word1[0..i - 2] to word2[0..j - 2], which is dp[i - 1][j - 1]. Now let's consider word[i - 1] and word2[j - 1].
If they are euqal, then no more operation is needed and dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]. Well, what if they are not equal?

If they are not equal, we need to consider three cases:

Replace word1[i - 1] by word2[j - 1] (dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1 (for replacement));
Delete word1[i - 1] and word1[0..i - 2] = word2[0..j - 1] (dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + 1 (for deletion));
Insert word2[j - 1] to word1[0..i - 1] and word1[0..i - 1] + word2[j - 1] = word2[0..j - 1] (dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + 1 (for insertion)).
Make sure you understand the subtle differences between the equations for deletion and insertion.
For deletion, we are actually converting word1[0..i - 2] to word2[0..j - 1], which costs dp[i - 1][j], and then deleting the word1[i - 1], which costs 1.
The case is similar for insertion.

Putting these together, we now have:

dp[i][0] = i;  这里的0指的是，没有任何字符参与进来，需要的操作数量。
dp[0][j] = j;
dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1], if word1[i - 1] = word2[j - 1];
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1, dp[i - 1][j] + 1, dp[i][j - 1] + 1), otherwise

        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++)
            dp[i][0] = i;
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++)
            dp[0][j] = j;
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1))
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                else dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1, Math.min(dp[i][j - 1] + 1, dp[i - 1][j] + 1));
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
